## Data Model
In this app, we will use 4 collections: users, restaurants, reviews/posts, and meet-ups collections. All Ids will be automatically generated by the firestore database.

1. Users Collection
   
Purpose: Stores user information and preferences to personalize recommendations and keep track of user activities.

Fields:
- name: User's display name.
- email: User's email for login and notifications.
- profilePhoto: URL of the user's profile picture.

2. Restaurants Collection
   
Purpose: Holds restaurant information, including details fetched from an external API (like Yelp).

Fields:
- name: Name of the restaurant.
- location: Coordinates or address of the restaurant.
- rating: Average rating of the restaurant.

4. Meet-ups Collection
   
Purpose: Stores information about organized meetups, allowing users to connect with friends and arrange group dining events.

Fields:
- restaurantId: ID of the restaurant where the meetup is taking place (links to Restaurants collection).
- Owner: ID of the user who created the meetup (links to Users collection).
- dateTime: Date and time of the meetup.
- notes: Additional notes or comments about the meetup (e.g., "Celebrate John's birthday" or "Try the new sushi menu").

## Implementation of CRUD operations
1. Users Collection
- Create: When a new user signs up, a user profile is created with information like name, email, preferences, and profile photo.
- Read: Retrieve user information for profile display, preferences, friends list, and personalized restaurant recommendations.
- Update: Users can update their profile information (e.g., change preferences, update profile photo) and manage their friends list or favorite restaurants.
- Delete: Account deletion allows the user to delete their profile and associated data from the app.

2. Restaurants Collection
- Create: Restaurants are fetched from an external API (like Yelp) and stored in the database for fast access. Users might also add a new restaurant if it’s not found in the API results.
- Read: Display restaurant details (name, location, rating, photos, reviews) on the app, especially in searches, map views, or personalized recommendations.
- Update: Occasionally update restaurant information (like rating or hours) to ensure data accuracy. The updates might come from periodic API calls.
- Delete: Unused or outdated restaurant entries may be removed from the database if they’re no longer relevant or accessible.

3. Reviews Collection
- Create: Users can write and add new reviews, including rating, text, and photos, for a specific restaurant.
- Read: Display reviews on the restaurant page or in user profiles, allowing other users to view shared experiences and recommendations.
- Update: Users can edit their own reviews to update the rating or content as needed.
- Delete: Users have the option to delete their own reviews if they no longer wish to share them.

4. Meetups Collection
- Create: Users can create a new meetup by selecting a restaurant, adding participants, and setting a date and time.
- Read: Display meetup information for participants, including date, location, and any additional notes, on their profiles or the restaurant’s page.
- Update: The organizer or participants can update the meetup details, such as changing the time, adding notes, or inviting more friends.
- Delete: The organizer can cancel or delete the meetup if plans change, removing it from participants’ schedules.

## Current State of the App - Iteration 1
At the end of iteration 1, we have React Native components created to represent the functionality we will be building, and the overall structure of the app is in place.We also have navigation and the basis of CRUD operations to Firestore established and working.
